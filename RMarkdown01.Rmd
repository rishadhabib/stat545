- use markdown files for Github
- ctrl + alt + i to insert a code chunk
- put a comma after r to set how the run will load


```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width = 4}
x <- rnorm(500)
y <- rnorm(500) 

plot (x, y)
```

```{r}

```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
#plot run

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#cm005

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library (tidyverse)
```

```{r}
##How many variables (columns) are in the iris dataset, and what are their names?
str(iris)
```

```{r}
#How many rows are in the data set?
nrow(iris)

```

```{r}
#What are the smallest values of each numeric variable?
summary(iris)
```

```{r}
#Extract the Petal.Width column to get a vector of observations (we’ll see vectors in more detail in a later class), and
petalwidth <- iris$Petal.Width
#Make a histogram
hist(petalwidth)
#Make a table of frequencies
table(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Species)
```

#2.2. dplyr fundamentals

```{r}
filter(gapminder, country=="Canada" & year >1970) #use the filter to choose your data
```


```{r}
#Find all entries of Canada and Algeria.
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Canada", "Algeria"))

#Find all entries of Canada and Algeria, occuring in the ’60s.
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Canada", "Algeria"), year >=1960 & year < 1970)

#Find all entries of Canada, and entries of Algeria occuring in the ’60s.
filter(gapminder, (country =="Canada")| (country == "Algeria"& year >=1960 & year < 1970))

#Find all entries not including European countries.
filter(gapminder, continent != "Europe")
