Loading packages

```{r include = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library (tidyverse)
```

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width = 4}
x <- rnorm(500)
y <- rnorm(500) 

plot (x, y)
```

```{r}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
#plot run

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##How many variables (columns) are in the iris dataset, and what are their names?
str(iris)
```

```{r}
#How many rows are in the data set?
nrow(iris)

```

```{r}
#What are the smallest values of each numeric variable?
summary(iris)
```

```{r}
#Extract the Petal.Width column to get a vector of observations (we’ll see vectors in more detail in a later class), and

```

2.2. dplyr fundamentals

```{r}
filter(gapminder, country=="Canada" & year >1970) #use the filter to choose your data
```


```{r}
#Find all entries of Canada and Algeria.
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Canada", "Algeria"))

#Find all entries of Canada and Algeria, occuring in the ’60s.
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Canada", "Algeria"), year >=1960 & year < 1970)

#Find all entries of Canada, and entries of Algeria occuring in the ’60s.
filter(gapminder, (country =="Canada")| (country == "Algeria"& year >=1960 & year < 1970))
#also: filter(gapminder, (country =="Canada")| (country == "Algeria"& year %in% 1960:1969)) 

#Find all entries not including European countries.
filter(gapminder, continent != "Europe")

```

select subsets data by columns/variable names.
```{r}
select(gapminder, continent, country) #you can use - to remove columns
```

The pipe operator %>% feeds the output of a function into another function
```{r}
gapminder %>%  #The pipe operator %>% feeds the output of a function into another function
  filter(country %in% c("Canada", "Algeria"), 
         year <= 1969, year >= 1960) %>% 
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) 
```


```{r}
#Exercise: Take all countries in Europe that have a GPD per capita greater than 10000, and select all variables except gdpPercap. (Hint: use -).
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe" & gdpPercap > 10000) %>%
  select (-gdpPercap)
```


arrange sorts a data frame by shuffling the order of the rows appropriately. Use desc to sort by descending order.
```{r}
arrange(gapminder, desc(pop), desc(lifeExp))
```
Exercises:

```{r}
#Order the data frame by year, then descending by life expectancy.
arrange(gapminder, year, desc(lifeExp))

#In addition to the above exercise, rearrange the variables so that year comes first, followed by life expectancy. (Hint: check the documentation for the select function for a related handy function).
gapminder %>%
  arrange(year, desc(lifeExp)) %>% 
  select (year, lifeExp, everything())
  
```


## Date: 21st September 2017

mutate creates a new variable by calculating from other variables. 
- transmute works the same way, but drops all other variables.
```{r}
mutate(gapminder, 
       gdp = gdpPercap * pop,
       gdpBill = round(gdp/10000000, 1))
```

```{r}
#Exercise: Make a new column called cc that pastes the country name followed by the continent, separated by a comma. (Hint: use the paste function with the sep=", " argument).

mutate(gapminder, country_cont = paste(country, continent, sep = ", "))
```

summarize reduces a tibble according to summary statistics.
```{r}
summarize(gapminder, mean_pop=mean(pop), sd_pop=sd(pop))
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(continent) %>% 
    summarize(mean_pop=mean(pop), sd_pop=sd(pop))
```
```{r}
group_by(gapminder, year<1970)
```
```{r}
(out1 <- gapminder %>% 
    group_by(continent, year < 1970) %>% 
    summarize(mean_pop=mean(pop), sd_pop=sd(pop)))
 
```
```{r}
#Exercise: Find the minimum GDP per capita experienced by each country
(out2 <- gapminder %>% 
    group_by(country) %>% 
    summarize(min.gdp=min(gdpPercap)))


#Exercise: How many years of record does each country have?
(out3 <- gapminder %>% 
    group_by(country) %>% 
    summarize(nyear = n_distinct(year)))

#Exercise: Within Asia, what are the min and max life expectancies experienced in each year?
gapminder%>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
    summarize (miexp = min(lifeExp), (maxexp = max(lifeExp)))

```

Using ggplot

```{r}
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp))
p + geom_point(alpha = .25)
```

```{r}
#Exercises:

#Make a scatterplot of gdpPercap vs lifeExp. Store it in a variable called p2.
p2 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p2 + geom_point()

#To p2, make the size of the points indicate the year, choose a level of alpha transparency that you’re happy with, and make the points your favourite colour.
p2 + geom_point(aes(size =year), alpha = .15, colour = "blue")

#To p2, colour the points by continent. but this time with year being represented by the size of the points.
p2 + geom_point(aes(size=year, colour = continent), alpha = .15)

#To p2, add another layer called scale_x_log10(). Make a second plot by redoing the plot in (1), but replacing gdpPercap with log10(gdpPercap). What do you notice?
#p3 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp))
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) + geom_point(aes(colour= continent)) + scale_x_log10()
```


# cm007

## Facetting

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour=continent))
```


#### facet_wrap: 1D facetting – we’ll focus on this first.
#### facet_grid: 2D facetting
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    facet_wrap(~ continent, scales = "free", ncol = 3, labeller = "label_both") + #scales and ncol used
    geom_point()
```

Exercise 4: Make a plot of year (x) vs lifeExp (y), facetted by continent. Then, fit a smoother through the data for each continent, without the error bars. Choose a span that you feel is appropriate.
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(y=lifeExp, x= year)) + 
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, span = 1, method="loess") #span only works with method="loess"
```

facet_grid puts the panels in a grid.
```{r}
vc2 <- gapminder %>% 
    mutate(size=ifelse(pop > 7000000, "large", "small")) %>% #facet by “small” (<=7,000,000 population) and “large” (>7,000,000 population) countries. 
    ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    facet_grid(size ~ continent, scales = "free" ) 
vc2 + geom_point(aes(colour=year)) #also try colour = continent
```



```{r}
vc2 + 
    geom_point(colour="red",
               alpha=0.2) +
    geom_smooth() +
    scale_x_log10()
```

#### Connect the dots with geom_line


geom_line: connect the dots from left-to-right.
geom_path: connect the dots in the order that they appear in the data frame.


```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(year, lifeExp, group = country)) + # make sure you specify group
    geom_line(alpha = .5, aes(colour = continent))
```

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(country=="Bangladesh") %>% 
    arrange(year) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(pop, gdpPercap)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(aes(label = year, hjust = 1.5))+
    geom_path()
```

Exercise 5: Plot the population over time (year) using lines, so that each country has its own line. Colour by  gdpPercap. Add alpha transparency to your liking.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(y=pop, x= year, group = country, colour = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .5)
```
Exercise 6: Add points to the plot in Exercise 5.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=pop, x= year, group = country, colour = gdpPercap))+
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
  
```

## Linear Regression

lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + ... + xp, data=your_data_frame)

```{r}
fit1 =  lm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data = gapminder)
fit1
```
```{r}
fit1_small <- lm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data=head(gapminder))
lapply(fit1_small, identity) 
```

```{r}
predict(fit1) %>% head
```

```{r}
qplot(log(gapminder$gdpPercap), predict(fit1))
```
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
    geom_point(y=predict(fit1), colour="blue") + #you can also use geom_smooth(method ="lm") to draw the line but you can't get the regression coefficients from ggplot, for that you need lm
    scale_x_log10()

```

```{r}
my_newdata <- data.frame(gdpPercap=c(100, 547, 289))
predict(fit1, newdata=my_newdata)
predict(fit1, newdata=filter(gapminder, country=="Canada"))
```


```{r}
fit1$coefficients # also can use coef(fit1) to find coefficients
fit1$residuals %>% head # also can use resid(fit1) %>% head to find residuals
# fit1$effects
# fit1$fitted.values
# fit1$qr
# fit1$call 
# fit1$model
```


```{r}
qplot(log(gapminder$gdpPercap), resid(fit1)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0,
               linetype="dashed") #you can add a horizontal line at any point using geom_hline
```


```{r}
summ_fit1 <- summary(fit1)
summ_fit1$r.squared
summ_fit1$adj.r.squared
summ_fit1$sigma   # standard deviation

?summary.lm # search for summary.lm documentation for all the variables included in the summary of class lm
?summary.glm
```
For GLM
## Poisson regression:
glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + ... + xp, family=poisson, data=your_data_frame)
## Logistic (aka Binomial) regression:
glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + ... + xp, family=binomial, data=your_data_frame)




# dplyr

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>% 
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              n_countries    = length(gdpPercap))
```

#### Calculating growth since the first record - pop[1]

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(country) %>%  # need to group so that R knows how to group to calculate things
    arrange(year) %>%      # should arrange the years so that row 1 is 1952
    mutate(pop_growth = pop - pop[1])
```



How about growth compared to 2007?

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(country) %>% 
    mutate(pop_growth = pop[year==2007] - pop)
```

#### Growth compared to the last years pop
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(country) %>% 
    mutate(pop_growth = pop - lag(pop))
```


Vectorized Functions: These take a vector, and operate on each component independently to return a vector of the same length. In other words, they work element-wise.
Examples are cos, sin, log, exp, round.
We don’t need to group_by in order to mutate with these.
Aggregate Functions: These take a vector, and return a vector of length 1 – as if “aggregating” the values in the vector into a single value.
Examples are mean, sd, length, typeof.
We use these in dplyr’s summarise function.
Window Functions: these take a vector, and return a vector of the same length that depends on other values in the vector.
Examples are lag, rank, cumsum.
See the window-functions vignette for the dplyr package.


## ggplot


### Themes: 
theme_grey #default
theme_gray
theme_bw #this is nice
theme_linedraw
theme_light #this is nice
theme_dark
theme_minimal #this is nice
theme_classic
theme_void
theme_test

 The arguments of theme follow a naming convention: general.to.specific
 axis.title 
 axis.title.x 
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    facet_wrap(~ continent) +
    geom_point(colour="#386CB0", alpha=0.2) +
    scale_x_log10()
p1 + theme_bw()
```

element_blank (basically means replace with “nothing”)
element_rect: allows us to specify features of a rectangle.
element_line: allows us to specify features of a line.
element_text: allows us to specify font.


```{r}
p1 + theme_bw()+
    theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill="yellow"),
          axis.title = element_text(size=14),
          strip.text = element_text(size=14, face="bold"))
```

### Modifying scales


[link to a tutorial](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/blob/master/scales.rmd)

- scale_x_continuous
- scale_colour_discrete
- scale_y_sqrt


```{r}
p1 + labs(x="GDP per capita", 
          y="Life Expectancy",
          title="A Plot of the World")
```
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour=continent),
               alpha=0.2) +
  scale_colour_discrete("Continents of\n the World") # \n is for a new line
    
```
breaks specify where along the scale you’d like to display a value.
```{r}
## Log lines:
p1 + scale_x_log10(breaks=c((1:10)*1000,
                            (1:10)*10000))
## Scale for 'x' is already present. Adding another scale for 'x', which
## will replace the existing scale.
```

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour=pop/10^9),
               alpha=0.5)
## Default breaks
p2 + scale_x_log10(breaks=c((1:10)*1000,
                            (1:10)*10000)) + 
  scale_colour_continuous("Population\nin billions")
```

```{r}
## Discrete scale:
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour=continent),
               alpha=0.2) +
    scale_colour_discrete(labels=c("Af", "Am", "As", "Eu", "Oc"))
```

## Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Suppose we want to calculate some quantity for each country in the gapminder data set. For each of the following quantities, indicate whether the function is vectorized, aggregate, or window, and use  dplyr functions to calculate the specified variable.


i.e., the value that appears for 1962 would be the gdpPercap in 1957 (the previous entry).
Hint: use the lag function, then filter out the NA’s created with the is.na function.

```{r}
# The change in population from 1962 to 1972.
gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c("1962", "1972")) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(popchange62 = pop[year == 1962] - pop[year == 1972]) %>%
  filter(year == 1972)

## alternative
gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c("1962", "1972")) %>%
           arrange(year) %>%
           group_by(country) %>%
                      summarize(pop_change = diff(pop))
```



```{r}
# The population, in billions.
gapminder %>%
  transmute(country, continent, popbil = pop/10^9)
```

```{r}
# The lagged gdpPercap
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(gdpgrowth = gdpPercap - lag(gdpPercap))
            
```


**Exercise 2:** For the gapminder dataset, make a spaghetti plot showing the population trend (in millions) over time for each country, facetted by continent. Make as many of the following modifications as you can:


```{r}
data2 <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(logmaxgdp = log(max(gdpPercap)))
```

- [X] Colour each line by the log maximum gdpPercap experienced by the country.
- [X] Rotate the x-axis labels to be vertical.
- [ ] Remove the x-axis title.
- [ ] Give the legend an appropriate title.
- [ ] Put the y-axis on a log-scale.
- [ ] Rename the y-axis title.
- [ ] Add more numbers along the y-axis.
- [ ] Give the plot a title, and center the title.
- [ ] Only label the x axis with years 1950, 1975, and 2000.
- [ ] Move the colour scale to the bottom.
- [ ] Rename the colour legend


```{r}
plot2 <- ggplot(data2, aes(x= year, y = pop, group = country, colour = logmaxgdp)) #Colour each line by the log maximum gdpPercap experienced by the country
plot2 + geom_line(size = 1, alpha = .5) + 
  facet_wrap( ~ continent, scales = "free") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + # Rotate the x-axis labels to be vertical.
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "log") + 
  ggtitle("Log of GDP by population for each continent") + #title
  labs(x = "Years from 1950 to 2007", y = "Population", colour = "Log of Max GDP") # adds axis & legend labels

```
